# Hello there!

Welcome to the hono-shop repository, here I am recreating the store that I made according to the course of Maximilian Schwarzmüller (NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)).

To be honest, I didn’t like the assembly and the site that I received, so I decided to make it quickly and without problems (but using my main NextJS technology)

This project used:

- "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.0",
- "clsx": "^2.1.1",
- "hono": "^4.6.10",
- "lucide-react": "^0.456.0",
- "next": "14.2.5",
- "react": "18.2.0",
- "react-dom": "18.2.0",
- "tailwind-merge": "^2.5.4",
- "tailwindcss-animate": "^1.0.7"
